    "NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is the foundational package for scientific com-puting in Python. The majority of this book will be based on NumPy and libraries builton top of NumPy.\n",

    "It provides, among other things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A fast and efficient multidimensional array object ndarray\n",
    "* Functions for performing element-wise computations with arrays or mathematicaloperations between arrays\n",
    "* Tools for reading and writing array-based data sets to disk\n",
    "* Linear algebra operations, Fourier transform, and random number generation\n",
    "* Tools for integrating connecting C, C++, and Fortran code to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the fast array-processing capabilities that NumPy adds to Python, one of itsprimary purposes with regards to data analysis is as the primary container for data tobe passed between algorithms. For numerical data, NumPy arrays are a much moreefficient way of storing and manipulating data than the other built-in Python datastructures. Also, libraries written in a lower-level language, such as C or Fortran, canoperate on the data stored in a NumPy array without copying any data."

They are notthe same, however; the functionality provided by data.frame in R is essentially a strictsubset of that provided by the pandas DataFrame. While this is a book about Python, Iwill occasionally draw comparisons with R as it is one of the most widely-used opensource data analysis environments and will be familiar to many readers.The pandas name itself is derived from panel data, an econometrics term for multidi-mensional structured data sets, and Python data analysis itself."
